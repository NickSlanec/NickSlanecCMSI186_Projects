Evaluation for homework 03: ClockSolver

Clock and ClockSolver programs
Includes running Clock main to observe tests
Includes running automated ClockSolver tests
   View testHW3.bat in your repo to see test parameters used
============================================================

Point structure for this assignment is one point wherever indicated.
There are a total of ten points for running ClockSolver with various
input values.  For each test, you get credit if you find *at least*
one occurrence of the angle and log it's time.

You get credit for the main() method for testing the Clock methods,
since I gave that code to you for free.  If you didn't add any more
tests to it, consider doing so from now on, so you'll get full credit
for testing in the module.

You also get credit for error checking code as follows:
   if you error check in the main, you get freebie credit for the
      error checking methods
   if you error check by calling the ClockSolver method, you get
      freebie credit for the other two error checking methods
   if you error check using all three, GOOD FOR YOU!! You are an
      increasingly competent Java programmer!!

Total 25 out of 27 = 92.59% which is an A-minus

I did get an infinite loop with your code when using a time slice value
of 0.0, so your error checking needs a bit more attention for that.  I
believe it was specified on the assignment page that the value needed
to be larger than zero, and I remember talking about that in class.

I also get an infinite loop when running with the time slice of 1801.0
seconds.  That should be an error condition.  I even get an infinite
loop when running the final test using the valid time slice of 1800.0
seconds.

Another thing to consider: instead of throwing an exception, try to
put out some meaningful message and shut down gracefully.  For example,
instead of:

	if (args.length == 0){
		throw new IllegalArgumentException ("Please enter an angle");
	}

consider:

	if (args.length == 0){
		System.out.println("Please enter an angle");
		System.exit( 0 );
	}

Using the throw makes sense in a method that has been called, but in
that case you catch the thrown exception in the caller, which in this
case is your main.

Nice work, Nick!

Total course grade so far:
homework00 @  5%:  100.00% =  5.00 points
homework01 @  5%:  100.00% =  5.00 points
homework02 @  5%:  100.00% =  5.00 points
homework03 @ 10%:   92.59% =  9.26 points
class part @ 10%:  100.00% = 10.00 points

                     total:  34.26 out of 35.00 points = 97.89% which is an A-plus
